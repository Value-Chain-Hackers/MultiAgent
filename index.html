    <h1>Teacher A.I. for Inchainge Simulations</h1>
    
    <div class="content-section">
        <h2>1. Project Overview</h2>
        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>To explore the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into Inchainge's simulation games to enhance learning experiences, provide real-time support, automate decision-making processes, and test how well current AI models can navigate and succeed in the games.</p>
        
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>Inchainge, a company specializing in supply chain and company simulation games, is keen to leverage recent developments in AI to improve its product offerings. With a strong global presence and a reputation for innovation, Inchainge aims to incorporate AI to offer advanced game-based learning solutions.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Questions from The Fresh Connection</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>AI-Powered Game Assistance:</strong> Can AI, like ChatGPT, provide real-time support and guidance within the game environment?</li>
            <li><strong>AI-Based Performance Analysis and Tips:</strong> How can AI analyze game outcomes to offer personalized feedback and strategic advice?</li>
